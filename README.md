# What is Auto_EACSF?
Automatic Extra-Axial Cerebrospinal Fluid (Auto EACSF) is an open-source, interactive tool for automatic computation of brain extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (EA-CSF) in magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans of infants. Elevated extra-axial fluid volume is a possible biomarker for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Auto EACSF aims to automatically calculate the volume of EA-CSF and could therefore be used for early diagnosis of Autism. Auto EACSF is a user-friendly application that generates a Qt application to calculate the volume of EA-CSF. The application is run through a GUI, but also provides an advanced use mode that allows execution of different steps by themselves via Python and XML scripts. 

# Build instructions
Requirements: Qt, Python

Build:
1. Get files from Github
```
$ git clone git@github.com:hay318/auto_EACSF.git
```
2. Make an out-of-source build directory
```
$ mkdir ./auto_EACSF-bin
$ cd auto_EACSF-bin
```
3. Configure the build
```
$ ccmake ../auto_EACSF/src
$ make
```
4. Get the executable
```
$ ./bin/auto_EACSF
```
5. Open the application by typing the line below (do not click to open). 
```
$ ./Auto_EACSF
```
